<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>We are very delighted that you have shown interest in joind.in.
    Data protection is of a particularly high priority to us.
    <!-- As we *always* process personal data (at least in terms of IP-Addresses) this
    sentence is utter nonsense. -->
    <!--The use of joind.in is possible without any indication
    of personal data; however, if you want to use special 
    services via our website, processing of personal data will become
    necessary. If the processing of personal data is necessary and there is
    no statutory basis for such processing, we generally obtain consent from you.--></p>

<p>The processing of personal data, such as your name, e-mail address or IP-address
    shall always be in line with the General Data Protection
    Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with the country-specific data
    protection regulations applicable to joind.in. By means of this data
    protection declaration, we would like to inform the general
    public of the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect,
    use and process. Furthermore, you are informed, by means of this
    data protection declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.</p>

<p>As the controller, joind.in has implemented numerous technical and
    organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal
    data processed through this website. However, Internet-based data
    transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection
    may not be guaranteed. For this reason, you are free to
    transfer personal data to us via alternative means, e.g. by telephone. </p>

<h2>1. Definitions</h2>
<p>The data protection declaration of joind.in is based on the terms used by
    the European legislator for the adoption of the General Data Protection
    Regulation (GDPR). Our data protection declaration should be legible
    and understandable for the general public, as well as our customers and
    business partners. To ensure this, we would like to first explain the
    terminology used.</p>

<p>In this data protection declaration, we use, inter alia, the following terms:</p>

<ul style="list-style: none">
    <li><h3>a) Personal data</h3>
        <p>Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”).

    </li>
    <li><h3>b) Data subject</h3>
        <p>Data subject is any identified or identifiable natural person, whose personal data is processed by the controller responsible for the processing.</p>

    </li>
    <li><h3>c)    Processing</h3>
        <p>Processing is any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction. </p>
    </li>
    <li><h3>d)    Restriction of processing</h3>
        <p>Restriction of processing is the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their processing in the future. </p>
    </li>
    <li><h3>e)    Profiling</h3>
        <p>Profiling means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements. </p>
    </li>
    <li><h3>f)     Pseudonymisation</h3>
        <p>Pseudonymisation is the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person. </p>
    </li>
    <li><h3>g)    Controller or controller responsible for the processing</h3>
        <p>Controller or controller responsible for the processing is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law. </p>
    </li>
    <li><h3>h)    Processor</h3>
        <p>Processor is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller. </p>
    </li>
    <li><h3>i)      Recipient</h3>
        <p>Recipient is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not. However, public authorities which may receive personal data in the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as recipients; the processing of those data by those public authorities shall be in compliance with the applicable data protection rules according to the purposes of the processing. </p>
    </li>
    <li><h3>j)      Third party</h3>
        <p>Third party is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data subject, controller, processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data.</p>
    </li>
    <li><h3>k)    Consent</h3>
        <p>Consent of the data subject is any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her. </p>

<h2>2. Name and Address of the controller</h2>
<p>Controller for the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),
    other data protection laws applicable in Member states of the European
    Union and other provisions related to data protection is:

<h2>3. Cookies</h2>
<p>joind.in uses cookies. Cookies are text files that are
    stored in a computer system via an Internet browser.</p>

<p>Many Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called
    cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of
    a character string through which Internet pages and servers can be assigned
    to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This allows
    visited Internet sites and servers to differentiate the individual browser
    of the dats subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies.
    A specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified using the
    unique cookie ID.</p>

<p>Through the use of cookies, joind.in can provide the users of this
    website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without
    the cookie setting.</p>

<p>By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can be
    optimized with the user in mind. Cookies allow us, as previously mentioned,
    to recognize our website users. The purpose of this recognition is to make
    it easier for users to utilize our website. The website user that uses
    cookies, e.g. does not have to enter access data each time the website is
    accessed, because this is taken over by the website, and the cookie is thus
    stored on the user's computer system. Another example is the cookie of a
    shopping cart in an online shop. The online store remembers the articles
    that a customer has placed in the virtual shopping cart via a cookie.</p>

<p>You may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through
    our website by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser
    used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Furthermore,
    already set cookies may be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or
    other software programs. This is possible in all popular Internet browsers.
    If you deactivate the setting of cookies in the Internet
    browser used, not all functions of our website may be entirely usable.</p>

<h2>4. Collection of general data and information</h2>
<p>The joind.in website collects a series of general data and information
    when you or an automated system calls up the website. This general
    data and information are stored in the server log files. Collected may be
    (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by
    the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches
    our website (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and
    time of access to the Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP
    address), (7) the Internet service provider of the accessing system, and
    (8) any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of
    attacks on our information technology systems.</p>

<p>When using these general data and information, joind.in does not draw
    any conclusions about you. Rather, this information is needed
    to (1) deliver the content of our website correctly, (2) optimize the
    content of our website as well as its advertisement, (3) ensure the
    long-term viability of our information technology systems and website
    technology, and (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the information
    necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack. Therefore,
    the joind.in analyzes anonymously collected data and information
    statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data
    security of our enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection
    for the personal data we process. The anonymous data of the server log
    files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data
    subject.</p>

<h2>5. Registration on our website</h2>
<p>You have the possibility to register on the website of the
    controller with the indication of personal data. Which personal data are
    transmitted to the controller is determined by the respective input mask
    used for the registration. The personal data entered by you
    is collected and stored exclusively for internal use by the controller,
    and for his own purposes. The controller may request transfer to one or
    more processors (e.g. a parcel service) that also uses personal data for an
    internal purpose which is attributable to the controller.</p>

<p>Your registration, with the voluntary indication of
    personal data, is intended to enable the controller to offer the data
    subject contents or services that may only be offered to registered users
    due to the nature of the matter in question. Registered persons are free to
    change the personal data specified during the registration at any time, or
    to have them completely deleted from the data stock of the controller.</p>

<p>The data controller shall, at any time, provide information upon request to
    you as to what personal data are stored about you. In addition, the data controller shall correct or erase personal
    data at your request or indication, insofar as there are
    no statutory storage obligations. The entirety of the controller’s members
    are available to you in this respect as contact persons.</p>

<h2>6. Contact possibility via the website </h2>
<p>The joind.in website contains information that enables a quick
    electronic contact to joind.in, as well as direct communication with
    us, which also includes a general address of the so-called electronic mail
    (e-mail address). If you contact the controller by e-mail or
    via the contact form, the personal data transmitted by you is
    automatically stored. Such personal data transmitted on a voluntary basis
    by you to the data controller are stored for the purpose of
    processing or contacting you. There is no transfer of this
    personal data to third parties.</p>

<h2>7. Routine erasure and blocking of personal data</h2>
<p>The data controller shall process and store the personal data of the data
    subject only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of storage,
    or as far as this is granted by the European legislator or other legislators
    in laws or regulations to which the controller is subject to.</p>

<p>If the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period prescribed
    by the European legislator or another competent legislator expires, the
    personal data are routinely blocked or erased in accordance with legal
    requirements.</p>

on joind.in is through the login-button. And that is not covered by this description -->
    
   <!--
    <h4>9. Data protection provisions about the application and use of Facebook</h4>
<p>On this website, the controller has integrated login with the enterprise
    Facebook. Facebook is a social network.</p>

<p>A social network is a place for social meetings on the Internet, an online
    community, which usually allows users to communicate with each other and
    interact in a virtual space. A social network may serve as a platform for
    the exchange of opinions and experiences, or enable the Internet community
    to provide personal or business-related information. Facebook allows social
    network users to include the creation of private profiles, upload photos,
    and network through friend requests.</p>

<p>The operating company of Facebook is Facebook, Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo
    Park, CA 94025, United States. If a person lives outside of the United
    States or Canada, the controller is the Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand
    Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland.</p>

<p>With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet website,
    which is operated by the controller and into which a Facebook component
    (Facebook plug-ins) was integrated, the web browser on the information
    technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted to download
    display of the corresponding Facebook component from Facebook through
    the Facebook component. An overview of all the Facebook Plug-ins may be
    accessed under https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/. During the
    course of this technical procedure, Facebook is made aware of what
    specific sub-site of our website was visited by the data subject.</p>

<p>If the data subject is logged in at the same time on Facebook, Facebook
    detects with every call-up to our website by the data subject—and for the
    entire duration of their stay on our Internet site—which specific sub-site
    of our Internet page was visited by the data subject. This information is
    collected through the Facebook component and associated with the respective
    Facebook account of the data subject. If the data subject clicks on one of
    the Facebook buttons integrated into our website, e.g. the "Like" button,
    or if the data subject submits a comment, then Facebook matches this
    information with the personal Facebook user account of the data subject and
    stores the personal data.</p>

<p>Facebook always receives, through the Facebook component, information about
    a visit to our website by the data subject, whenever the data subject is
    logged in at the same time on Facebook during the time of the call-up to
    our website. This occurs regardless of whether the data subject clicks on
    the Facebook component or not. If such a transmission of information to
    Facebook is not desirable for the data subject, then he or she may prevent
    this by logging off from their Facebook account before a call-up to our
    website is made.</p>

<p>The data protection guideline published by Facebook, which is available at
    https://facebook.com/about/privacy/, provides information about the
    collection, processing and use of personal data by Facebook. In addition,
    it is explained there what setting options Facebook offers to protect the
    privacy of the data subject. In addition, different configuration options
    are made available to allow the elimination of data transmission to
    Facebook. These applications may be used by the data subject to eliminate
    a data transmission to Facebook.</p>

<h4>10. Data protection provisions about the application and use of Twitter</h4>
<p>On this website, the controller has integrated components of Twitter.
    Twitter is a multilingual, publicly-accessible microblogging service on
    which users may publish and spread so-called ‘tweets,’ e.g. short messages,
    which are limited to 140 characters. These short messages are available for
    everyone, including those who are not logged on to Twitter. The tweets are
    also displayed to so-called followers of the respective user. Followers are
    other Twitter users who follow a user's tweets. Furthermore, Twitter allows
    you to address a wide audience via hashtags, links or retweets.</p>

<p>The operating company of Twitter is Twitter, Inc., 1355 Market Street,
    Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, UNITED STATES.</p>

<p>With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site,
    which is operated by the controller and on which a Twitter component
    (Twitter button) was integrated, the Internet browser on the information
    technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted to download
    a display of the corresponding Twitter component of Twitter. Further
    information about the Twitter buttons is available under
    https://about.twitter.com/de/resources/buttons. During the course of this
    technical procedure, Twitter gains knowledge of what specific sub-page of
    our website was visited by the data subject. The purpose of the integration
    of the Twitter component is a retransmission of the contents of this website
    to allow our users to introduce this web page to the digital world and
    increase our visitor numbers.</p>

<p>If the data subject is logged in at the same time on Twitter, Twitter
    detects with every call-up to our website by the data subject and for the
    entire duration of their stay on our Internet site which specific sub-page
    of our Internet page was visited by the data subject. This information is
    collected through the Twitter component and associated with the respective
    Twitter account of the data subject. If the data subject clicks on one of
    the Twitter buttons integrated on our website, then Twitter assigns this

    has visited our website, provided that the data subject is logged in on
    Twitter at the time of the call-up to our website. This occurs regardless
    of whether the person clicks on the Twitter component or not. If such a
    transmission of information to Twitter is not desirable for the data

<h2>9. Legal basis for the processing </h2>
<p>Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations
    for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the
    processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract
    to which you are party, as is the case, for example, when
    processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide
    any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The
    same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying
    out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries
    concerning our products or services. Is joind.in subject to a legal
    obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for
    the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1)
    lit. c GDPR.
    In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect
    the vital interests of you or of another natural person. Then the
    processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR.
    Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR.
    This legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered
    by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for
    the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by joind.in or by a
    third party, except where such interests are overridden by your interests
    or fundamental rights and freedoms which require
    protection of personal data. Such processing operations are particularly
    permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European
    legislator. He considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if
    you a client of joind.in (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).
</p>

<h2>10. The legitimate interests pursued by joind.in or by a third party</h2>
<p>Where the processing of personal data is based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR
    our legitimate interest is to carry out our business in favor of the
    well-being of all our members and teams.</p>

<h2>11. Period for which the personal data will be stored</h2>
<p>The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is the
    respective statutory retention period. After expiration of that period,
    the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer
    necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation of a
    contract.</p>

<h2>12. Provision of personal data as statutory or contractual requirement;
    Requirement necessary to enter into a contract; Obligation of the data
    subject to provide the personal data; possible consequences of failure to
    provide such data </h2>
<p>We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law
    (e.g. tax regulations) or can also result from contractual provisions
    (e.g. information on the contractual partner).

    Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that you
    provide us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed by us.
    You are, for example, obliged to provide us with personal data
    when our company signs a contract with you. The non-provision of
    the personal data would have the consequence that the contract with you could not be concluded.

    Before personal data is provided by you, you must
    contact joind.in via the contact-form so that we can clarify whether
    the provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or is
    necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an
    obligation to provide the personal data and the consequences of
    non-provision of the personal data.
